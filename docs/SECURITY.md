# Security and privacy design

This summarizes the measures in the app and where to find them in the code.

## Permissions (least privilege)

| Permission | Why | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `INTERNET`, `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` | Fetch weather; detect satellite/constrained networks | |
| `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` + `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` | "Use my location" | Requested together only when the user taps it, so the system dialog lets them choose precise or approximate. Foreground only; never background location. |
| `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | Alert notifications (Android 13+) | Requested once, after a location exists |
| `ACCESS_LOCAL_NETWORK` ("Nearby devices") | Reach a WeeWX server on the user's LAN (enforced on Android 17+) | Requested only when a station URL resolves to a local-network address. Without it, the station is skipped with an explanation instead of a hung connection. |

`ACCESS_WIFI_STATE`, which the MapLibre SDK would otherwise merge in, is
removed with `tools:node="remove"`. Positions are rounded to 4 decimal places
(about 11 m) before leaving the location provider, and are sent only to the
weather services described below.

## Network

- **Built-in services are HTTPS only**, pinned to system CAs in
  `res/xml/network_security_config.xml` (weather.gov, noaa.gov, iastate.edu,
  openfreemap.org, openweathermap.org). Built-in endpoint URLs are constants.
  URLs returned by weather.gov are followed only if they stay on the API host
  (`NwsClient.requireNwsUrl`).
- **User-configured servers (WeeWX)** are validated by `UrlPolicy`:
  - only `http`/`https`, no credentials embedded in the URL;
  - plain `http` only for private-network addresses (RFC 1918, loopback,
    link-local, CGNAT/Tailscale, IPv6 ULA);
  - hostnames used over `http` must *resolve* to private addresses
    (`PrivateNetworkDns`), which defeats DNS rebinding;
  - credentials (Basic auth, tokens, custom headers) are **never** sent over
    `http`.
- `CleartextGuardInterceptor` is a final in-app check on every request. An
  `http://` request must be explicitly tagged as a local-server request and
  must not carry an `Authorization` header.
- The app targets API 37, so **Certificate Transparency** is enforced and
  **Encrypted Client Hello** is used where servers support it.
- Redirects between http and https are never followed (`followSslRedirects(false)`).
- Response bodies are size-capped (512 KB from user servers, 4 MB otherwise).
- The platform config permits cleartext only in the `base-config`, which
  applies to user-configured hosts. That is the only way Android allows
  `http://192.168.x.x`, and the app-level checks above narrow it further.
- User-installed CAs are trusted only for user-configured hosts, so a
  self-hosted WeeWX server with a private CA can use HTTPS. The built-in
  weather services never trust user CAs.
- Lint flags these two `base-config` allowances (`InsecureBaseConfiguration`,
  `AcceptsUserCertificates`). They are suppressed with `tools:ignore` in
  `network_security_config.xml`, with the reasoning above recorded inline.

## Secrets

- The OpenWeatherMap key and WeeWX passwords/tokens are encrypted with
  AES-256-GCM under a non-exportable **Android Keystore** key
  (`SecretStore`). The entry name is bound as associated data.
- Secrets are write-only in the UI: screens show whether a value is saved,
  never the value itself. Credential screens set `FLAG_SECURE`, which blocks
  screenshots, screen recording and the recent-apps thumbnail.
- The OpenWeatherMap key travels as a query parameter (OWM's API requires it).
  Those requests are sent with `Cache-Control: no-store`, so the URL is never
  written to the HTTP disk cache.
- No secrets, URLs or coordinates are logged, and R8 strips `Log.v/d/i` from
  release builds.

## Data at rest and backups

- `android:allowBackup="false"`, and `data_extraction_rules.xml` excludes all
  domains from cloud backup and device-to-device transfer.
- Cached weather and alert state live in `noBackupFilesDir`.
- Cache file names derived from location IDs are sanitized against path traversal.

## Components and intents

- The release build exports only the launcher activity plus three library
  components, each guarded by a permission only the OS or adb shell holds:
  WorkManager's `SystemJobService` (`BIND_JOB_SERVICE`), and WorkManager's
  `DiagnosticsReceiver` and the profile installer's `ProfileInstallReceiver`
  (`DUMP`). Debug builds additionally contain Compose's test and preview
  activities.
- Notification `PendingIntent`s are `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` and target an explicit
  component. Extras received by `MainActivity` are validated (location IDs
  must be short alphanumeric strings).

## Third parties and privacy

- No analytics, crash reporting, ads or tracking SDKs.
- Over satellite links, each data type can be blocked individually, which also
  limits what leaves the device on that network.
- Requests go only to: api.weather.gov (NWS), mapservices.weather.noaa.gov
  (NOAA radar), mesonet.agron.iastate.edu (HRRR future cast / alternative
  radar), tiles.openfreemap.org (basemap), the user's WeeWX server, and
  api.openweathermap.org (only if enabled with the user's key).
- Place search uses the platform `Geocoder` (on most devices this is backed
  by the system location provider) and OpenWeatherMap geocoding only if the
  user enabled OWM.
- The optional NWS contact email is sent only to weather.gov, inside the
  User-Agent header, as NWS requests.

## Supply chain and build

- Dependencies resolve only from Google Maven and Maven Central, and modules
  cannot add repositories (`FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS`). Google Maven is limited
  to Android/Google/AndroidX groups.
- Versions are pinned in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`.
- Release builds are minified and resource-shrunk. Signing keys are never
  committed (`keystore.properties` and `*.jks` are git-ignored).
